\arguments{
\item{segstats}{GRanges object of intervals with meta data fields "mean" and "sd" (i.e. output of segstats function)}

\item{allelic}{logical flag, if TRUE will also look for mean_high, sd_high, mean_low, sd_low variables and choose among top solutions from top copy number according to the best allelic fit}

\item{mc.cores}{integer number of cores to use (default 1)}
}
\value{
data.frame with top purity and ploidy solutions and associated gamma and beta values, for use in downstream jbaMI
}
\description{
least squares grid search for purity and ploidy modes
}
