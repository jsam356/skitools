\item{ALL}{logical flag, if ALL = T, will also include vertices without outgoing and incoming edges in paths}

\item{sources}{graph indices to treat as sources (by default is empty)}

list of integer vectors corresponding to indices in A (i.e. vertices)

\description{
Low level function to enumerate all elementary paths and cycles through graph

takes directed graph represented by n x n binary adjacency matrix  A and outputs all cycles and paths between source.vertices, sink.vertices
}
