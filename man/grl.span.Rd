grl.span(grl, chr = NULL, ir = FALSE, keep.strand = TRUE)
}

\item{grl}{\link{GRangesList} to query}

\item{chr}{[Default NULL]}

\item{ir}{[Default FALSE]}

\item{keep.strand}{[Default TRUE]}
}
\description{
Returns GRanges object representing the left / right extent of each GRL item.  In case of "chimeric" GRL items (ie that map
to two chromosomes) there are two options:
(1) specify "chr" chromosome as argument to subset GRL's that are on that chromosome, and compute GRL extents from this, any GRL
    full outside of that chromosome will get a 0 width GRL
(2) (default) allow chimeric GRL items to get an extent that is with respect to the first chromosome in that GRL
}
\details{
If a grl item contains ranges that lie on different chromosomes, then corresponding grange will have chromosome "NA" and IRange(0, 0)
}
